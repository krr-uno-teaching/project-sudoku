# Sudoku Project
The first assignment consists on developing a sudoku solver.

The task of this project is to solve a Generalized Sudoku puzzle using ASP. The goal of the traditional Sudoku game is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all numbers from 1 to 9.  In other words, the grid has to be filled with numbers from 1 to 9 so that the same number does not appear twice in the same row, column or in any of the nine 3x3 sub-grids of the 9x9 playing board. Initially, the grid is partially filled. 

One example of the 9x9 Sudoku is shown in the next figure. The left side shows the initial configuration, and the right side shows the same puzzle with solution numbers marked in red.

The initial state of the grid is represented by facts of predicate initial/3:
```
initial(X,Y,N). % initially cell [X,Y] contains number N
```
For instance, the example shown in the previous figure is represented by the following facts:

```
%%file asp/instances/ex00.lp
initial(1,1,5). initial(1,2,3). initial(1,5,7).
initial(2,1,6). initial(2,4,1). initial(2,5,9). initial(2,6,5).
initial(3,2,9). initial(3,3,8). initial(3,8,6).
initial(4,1,8). initial(4,5,6). initial(4,9,3).
initial(5,1,4). initial(5,4,8). initial(5,6,3). initial(5,9,1).
initial(6,1,7). initial(6,5,2). initial(6,9,6).
initial(7,2,6). initial(7,7,2). initial(7,8,8).
initial(8,4,4). initial(8,5,1). initial(8,6,9). initial(8,9,5).
initial(9,5,8). initial(9,8,7). initial(9,9,9).
```

The solution is represented by atoms of predicate sudoku/3:
```
sudoku(X,Y,N). % the cell [X,Y] contains number N
```
For instance, the solution of the previous figure consists of the following atoms:
```
sudoku(1,1,5) sudoku(1,2,3) ... sudoku(1,8,1) sudoku(1,9,2)
...
sudoku(9,1,3) sudoku(9,2,4) ... sudoku(9,8,7) sudoku(9,9,9)
```

## Formalities.
You can work on the solution by yourself or in groups. Different groups have to submit different solutions, in case of plagiarism all groups involved will fail the project.

Your solution has to correctly encode all solutions for every instance. Our test instances usually have several solutions. Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's judgments -- will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.

The content of the **main** branch of your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your submission. Any modifications after the deadline will be ignored. So will be any previous code that you committed before. Note that the autograder will give you the evaluation of your last commit, so be sure that it is what you expected.

**Start as soon as possible to avoid running out of time.**

Do not modify the file ```autograder.py``` nor any of the content of the directories ```.git```, ```.github```, ```img```, ```instances```, ```questions``` and ``` solutions```. Modifying some of these directories may prevent your code from working or cause lost of your progress. 

**Academic Dishonesty**: We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. Modifying the behavior of the autograder in any way is also cheating. We trust you all to submit your own work only and to do it honestly; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

## Question 0: Git and GitHub (10 points)

We will use Git and GitHub as a framework for developing this project. This question will help you to familiarize yourself with these tools. The first step is to clone this repository into your computer. For this, click the button **Code** in the right top corner of this page and copy the URL. Then, go to a terminal in your computer and type
```sh
git clone <URL>
```
A new directory with the name of this project will be created. Now create a file ```group.txt``` and write the name of each of the components of the group in a different line (if you work alone just add your name in the first line). Add it to the list of tracked files by typing
```sh
git add group.txt
```
Commit the change to the repository with the command
```sh
git commit -am"creating group.txt"
```
Finally, update the GitHub repository by typing the command 
```sh
git push
```
After a few minutes, you will be able to see the result of the test in the **Actions** tab.
**You should have obtained 5 points.**
Failing to correctly complete this step may prevent us from identifying you as the owner of the repository!

You can get more information about the result of the test by clicking successively on:
1. The specific test.
2. "Autograding".
3. "Run education/autograding@v1".

Now copy the file ```sudoku.lp``` to ```sudoku1a.lp``` and update the repository following the same steps as above. Note that when you create a new commit you should give a meaningful comment. For instance, now you can create a new commit using the command
```sh
git commit -am"creating sudoku1a.lp"
```
Every time you push a new commit, your solution will be tested automatically. This also applies to the following questions.
**You should have obtained now 10 points.**

We recommend that you create new commits frequently when doing the rest of this project. If at some point you realize you made a mistake, you can revert to a previous commit. Pushing to the GitHub repository may also help you in case you accidentally lose your local copy. If you have doubts about Git or Github, or you can learn more about it, you can read the tutorial at the following link:

https://github.com/Advanced-Concepts-Programming-Languages/github-starter-course

In addition, if you submit a question to the instructors, please include the link to your GitHub repository and be sure that you have pushed the latest version of your code.

## Question 1: 4x4 Sudoku
To begin with, you will represent a 4x4 Sudoku. Later you will modify it to handle the 9x9 case.

### Question 1a (25 points):
For this question, you should copy the file `sudoku.`lp``` to ```sudoku1a.lp``` and modify the latter. You should fill the board with a number between 1 and 4 in each cell such that each column and each row contains all numbers between 1 and 4.

The following command can be used to find all answer sets of a particular instance stored in file ```instances/4x4/ex00.lp```:
```sh
clingo sudoku1a.lp instances/4x4/ex00.lp 0
```
To receive credit for this question, your code must correctly solve all instances in the folder instances/4x4. Solutions to this question can be found in the folder solutions/q1a.

You can automatically test your code running
```sh
python autograder.py --question=1a
```
The timeout per instance is 100 seconds. This timeout also applies to the following questions.
If the autograder tells you that your code does not correctly solve a particular instance, then you can check the expected solutions by checking the file
```sh
solutions/q1a/<instance>.json
```
Solutions for subsequent questions can be found by changing the folder ```q1a``` for the corresponding question.

### Question 1b (15 points):
For this question, you should copy ```sudoku1a.lp``` to ```sudoku1b.lp``` and modify the latter. All stable models of this new program must contain facts of the form:
```
subgrid(x,y,g)
```
for each cell (x,y) in the board where g is the subgrid each belongs.
The top leftmost four cells belong to the subgrid 1.
The top rightmost four cells belong to the subgrid 2.
The bottom leftmost four cells belong to the subgrid 3.
The bottom rightmost four cells belong to the subgrid 4.
You can automatically test your code running
```sh
python autograder.py --question=1b
```
### Question 1c (15 points):
For this question, you should copy ```sudoku1b.lp``` to ```sudoku1c.lp``` and modify the latter. Each stable model of this program must be a solution to the 4x4 sudoku. That is, the board must be filled with a number between 1 and 4 in each cell such that each column, each row and each subgrid contains all numbers between 1 and 4.

Only the facts of the form sudoku(x,y,n) should be printed in the stable model. For this, your code should contain a statement of the form
```
#show sudoku/3.
```
and no other show statements.

To receive credit for this question, your code must correctly solve all instances in the folder instances/4x4. Solutions to this question can be found in the folder solutions/q1c.

You can automatically test your code running
```sh
python autograder.py --question=1c
```
## Question 2: 9x9 Sudoku (35 points)
For this question, we will represent a 9x9 Sudoku. Start by copying the file `sudoku1c.lp` to ```sudoku2.lp``` and modify the latter to solve the 9x9 sudoku. 

To receive credit for this question, the program must correctly solve all instances in the folder instances/9x9. Solutions to this question can be found in the folder solutions/q2.

The program can be automatically tested  by running:
```sh
python autograder.py --question=2
```
**Be sure you have committed your changes, pushed them to the GitHub repository and see the grade you expected to receive in the Actions tab in GitHub.**
